            <p1>Introduced to Tinkercad and some of the basics. Went over creating holes into basic shapes <br>
        using other basic shapes. Created a toaster also :).

            <p1>Built boats from paper it floated for the 5 minutes. Learned that surface area helps boats float
            the best and allows them to carry more wieght. Assuming that you oly have one piece of paper and you
            can't use tape the best thing to do is to have one flat sheet of paper apparently.

        <h2><b><hr>PROJECT 1: Rube Goldberg</b></h2>
        
        <br><br>
        
            <p1>The goal of the project was to pop a balloon using a rube goldberg machine made of cardboard
            using three basic machines, in our case a pulley, ramp, and wheels. My initial CAD was a pulley
            with two cups and putting a baseball in one end will cause the other cup to rise up and hit a car
            which then would hit the balloon encased in a box and pop it using a needle. Upon actually trying
            to build we had to change one of the cups with an eraser since two cups would hit eachother,
            the car instead of being on a flat part of the ramp had to be placed on tape and knocked off
            since it was more reliable and easier to set up, and the balloon placed next to a small barrier
            instead of in a box since the box would take too much cardboard. The most challenging problem to
            fix was setting up the ramp to be stable and be able to be hit and even in the final version is
            still unreliable. In the end the ramp was taped to the base plate of the pulley. One of the final
            changes made was replacing the system holding the balloon in place from the barrier to taping it
            to the table as to allow the car to hit it well enough to pop the balloon. After several attempts
            the car was able to pop the balloon.

                <p1>Learned how components in a computer work with eachother. Disassembled
                an ancient laptop and identified then labeled parts.Disassembled laptop below.
