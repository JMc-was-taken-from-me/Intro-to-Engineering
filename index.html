            <p1>Introduced to Tinkercad and some of the basics. Went over creating holes into basic shapes <br>
        using other basic shapes. Created a toaster also :).

            <p1>Built boats from paper it floated for the 5 minutes. Learned that surface area helps boats float
            the best and allows them to carry more wieght. Assuming that you oly have one piece of paper and you
            can't use tape the best thing to do is to have one flat sheet of paper apparently.

        <h2><b><hr>PROJECT 1: Rube Goldberg (Sept. 23, 2022)</b></h2>
        
        <br><br>
        
            <p1>The goal of the project was to pop a balloon using a rube goldberg machine made of cardboard
            using three basic machines, in our case a pulley, ramp, and wheels. My initial CAD was a pulley
            with two cups and putting a baseball in one end will cause the other cup to rise up and hit a car
            which then would hit the balloon encased in a box and pop it using a needle. Upon actually trying
            to build we had to change one of the cups with an eraser since two cups would hit eachother,
            the car instead of being on a flat part of the ramp had to be placed on tape and knocked off
            since it was more reliable and easier to set up, and the balloon placed next to a small barrier
            instead of in a box since the box would take too much cardboard. The most challenging problem to
            fix was setting up the ramp to be stable and be able to be hit and even in the final version is
            still unreliable. In the end the ramp was taped to the base plate of the pulley. One of the final
            changes made was replacing the system holding the balloon in place from the barrier to taping it
            to the table as to allow the car to hit it well enough to pop the balloon. After several attempts
            the car was able to pop the balloon.

            <p1>started unit on electrical engineering and used bread boards on tinkercads so as to not explode 
        actual leds. Tasked with building two circuits and this one at least worked. Here is an image of my good circuit.</p1>

            <p1>Selected a bridge idea and started assembly. The bridge will use triangles to maintian structural
            stability and will resemble a real life bridge. We have to wait until the glue drys which will take 
            about 1 day.</p1>

            <p1>Continued buidling bridges that were similar in design to actual bridges. Idea as to use tringles to 
            support the bridge. Ends of the bridge were not strong enough so it broke at the weak point.

        <i><hr>Mar. 9, 2023</i>
            <p1>We had a project that spanne over multiple weeks and out of the 3 avalible options (social engineering,
            an Arduino car, and a mouse trap car) we chose to build a mouse trap car. During the first week we quickly
            modeled a CAD of the design we were going to use. The design would use rulers and it was pretty simple, I 
            designed it as such so that we could build multiple iterations fast and would stay lighweight. I was absent
            for a lot of the time which kind of knee capped how much I could do to help the project. During the last
            couple weeks it was a scramble to try and finish the project but by the end we couldn't get it working to 
            test it with the rest of the cars. After getting an extension we added a more stable base, tried to get 
            the wheels working, and improved the mouse trap and string assembly. This second iteration was able to be 
            tested but it couldn't move so that's what ended up being the final product. Below will be an image of the 
            final mousetrap car.</p1>

            <p1>We designed a box with padding and a balloon so that an egg could be placed inside and stay intact after falling
            two stories. The box did not work and the egg broke. The balloons did not slow down the box adequetly so it hit the ground
            too hard and broke the egg.</p1>

            <p1> Last week, I finished the measurements and the CAD of the boat. There is a clear plan about how the boat
            will be constructed. It will be a kayak shape with multiple layers of cardboard on the bottom and water proofing
            using duct tape.</p1>
            
        <i><hr>Apr. 20, 2023</i>
            <p1>All the parts of the cardboard boat are done, we are waiting for tape. The goal is to have the boat
            carry two people across a pool and back without sinking. Our design is a conoe/kayak type thing.
            link: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/4UBSTWbhtp9 to the initial boat cad, the boat will be differnt
            since it will have triangles on both ends and the dimensions will be a little bit different.</p1>

<p1>All the pieces of the boat's bottom are cut out. I need to get more cardboard to layer on the base as well as to layer underneath to cover
up the spaces. Today, the perimeter was measured out by me and so I can cut out a wall properly. I have done everything I can do without the tape
so I just need to wait for some tape.
