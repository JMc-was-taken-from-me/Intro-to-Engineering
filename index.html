            <p1>Introduced to Tinkercad and some of the basics. Went over creating holes into basic shapes <br>
        using other basic shapes. Created a toaster also :).

            <p1>Built boats from paper it floated for the 5 minutes. Learned that surface area helps boats float
            the best and allows them to carry more wieght. Assuming that you oly have one piece of paper and you
            can't use tape the best thing to do is to have one flat sheet of paper apparently.
